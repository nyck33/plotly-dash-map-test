I am still working on getting the coordinates outputted on zoom or drag 
rather than on click on any spot on the map.  

Plotly-Dash Leaflet (https://dash-leaflet.herokuapp.com/) is based on React Leaflet 
but the documentation implies that not all features are implemented.

# Instructions

### 1. Please create a virtual environment for Python 3.8.8 with the requirements.txt
(I used conda)
command: pip install -r requirements.txt
### 2. The program can be run to show coordinates next to a random name or the capital cities
### For capital cities please run
### command: python3 showTell1.py capitals
or 
### comamnd: python showTell1.py capitals
### For random names no argument is required so please run:
### command: python3 showTell1.py
or
### command: python showTell.py

### 3. It should launch at 
### http://127.0.0.1:8050/ 
### or 
### http://localhost:8050/

### 4. Please click-drag and/or zoom the map and click somewhere on the map area.
